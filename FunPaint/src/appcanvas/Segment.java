    homework:

    add constructor, one that takes two points,
    and one that takes another Segment and copies it.

    add setters and getters.

    prevent aliasing.

    - add a method that returns the length of the segment (double)

    - distance of a point from the line that this segment is on it.

    - override the methods: equals and toString
    - add a method that will return the slope of the line.
        the slope is delta y divided by delta x
